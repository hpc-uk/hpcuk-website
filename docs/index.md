## HPC Documentation

This page provides links to documentation for UK national HPC facilities
and other useful documentation - including a repository of compile instructions
for various software on different HPC facilities.

If you think there are links to documentation missing from this page that should
be here, you can either:

 - add the missing information by forking the website repository and raising a pull request; or
 - raise an issue on the website repository.

### Compiling HPC Applications

Information on compiling HPC applications is usually available as
part of the standard application documentation. However, many 
HPC applications are complex and the specific instructions for 
different HPC platforms can differ from the standard instructions.

A number of resources are available with compile instructions for 
specific UK HPC facilities.

    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/hpc-uk/build-instructions">Compiling HPC Applications on UK facilities</a>
      The HPC-UK community build repository provides compilation instructions for compiling
      many applications on UK HPC facilities hosted on GitHub. Contributions to this repository 
      from the community are welcome.

       Building on original work from the ARCHER CSE service, this repository contains a number of
       different HPC benchmarks that have been run on UK HPC facilities. The repository contains
       information on compiling and running the benchmarks, raw results from various facilities,
       analysis scripts and reports on the data.
