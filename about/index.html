<h2>About HPC UK</h2>

<p>
We bring together different not-for-profit organisations involved in HPC in the UK
to provide information to users of HPC facilities.
</p>

<p>
HPC-UK provides information for users and providers on UK HPC facilities.
This includes information on facilities available, how to gain access, what
training courses are available and links to other useful resources.
</p>

<h2 id="hpc">What is HPC?</h2>

<p>
HPC (High-performance computing) is the use of many parallel computing
elements (e.g. CPUs) to solve complex problems.
</p>

<p>
Applications that use HPC typically require high levels of
floating point performance, large amounts of fast memory, the ability
to communicate quickly between different processes, access to large
amounts of fast disk storage, or any combination of the above.
</p>

<p>
HPC is used extensively in many different domains. Traditionally it has
been particularly important in scientific research and engineering
but more recently it has also become key to medical science and
complex data analysis.

      A consortium of eight UK universities, led by the University of Oxford has established a new
      computing facility known as the Joint Academic Data science Endeavour (JADE). JADE has been
      designed for the needs of machine learning and related data science applications. There has
      been huge growth in machine learning in the last 5 years, and this is the first national
      facility to support this rapid development, with the university partners including the
      world-leading machine learning groups in Oxford, Edinburgh, KCL, QMUL, Sheffield and UCL.
